# Chapter 1: Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer turnover, occurs when a customer chooses to leave or unsubscribe from a service for any reason. In the context of this project, we are looking at customer churn in banking. Being able to predict customer churn is important because we want to retain as many customers as we can. Of course you want to keep customers, but it also is cheaper to retain your customers, than having to spend money to acquire new customers to replace the ones that left. Lower customer acquisition costs equal more profits. By identifying customers at risk of churn, we are able to identify which efforts in order to maximize their likelihood of staying. 

In our research, we aim, through EDA, to identify the variables which have the highest correlation with churn, across three countries serviced by a multinational bank. The variables identified can then be used to inform banks of what customer activity trends and attributes should be monitored so the bank can make efforts to retain the customers before the account has been closed.

This report is organized as follows:

# Choosing the Topic

We chose to analyze a multinational bank’s churn for several reasons. As an international team, we were interested in topics that spanned multiple countries, with a particular focus on either business or environment, our personal interests. When we were pitching topics, nearly every suggestion was geared towards sales or customer experience, or global environmental issues. After ensuring that the data sets that interested us had enough observations to follow the project’s guidelines, we then identified the topics with the highest number of useful variables. There were several data sets, which, while interesting, did not yield enough useful variables. Rather, they included variables like unique product, user, or review identifiers, which were not relevant to the type of analysis we were performing. From our short-list, the Bank Customer Churn Data Set had the highest number of useful variables, 11 out of the 12, as opposed to 4-6 useful variables for our runner-up options. We made the decision to go with our chosen data set because we figured that a larger number of variables (and data) is a closer reflection of the multitude of factors that affect a customer’s decision to churn. Additionally, we do not know at first glance which of the variables will end up being statistically significant, however, by having a higher number of variables, we are considering the potential effects of a wider range of variables, which may be useful to our model after we perform EDA.

After finding a data set that piqued our personal interests, met the project requirements, and had a larger range of variables than the other top choices, we were satisfied with our choice and able to proceed to the next stage.
